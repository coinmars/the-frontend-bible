# Frontend-Performance-Best-Practices

- Minimize HTTP requests: Reducing the number of HTTP requests by combining CSS and JavaScript files, using image sprites, and compressing resources can improve page load times.

- Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN): A CDN can deliver static files from a server that is geographically closer to the user, reducing latency and improving load times.

- Optimize images: Compressing and resizing images can reduce their file size and improve page load times.

- Minify code: Minifying CSS and JavaScript code can reduce their file size, improving load times.

- Use caching: Caching resources such as images, CSS, and JavaScript can reduce server load and improve page load times.

- Lazy loading: Loading images and other resources only when they are needed can reduce page load times.

- Reduce DOM size: Reducing the number of elements in the DOM can improve rendering times and reduce memory usage.

- Use a performance monitoring tool: Tools such as Google Lighthouse or WebPageTest can help identify performance issues and suggest optimizations.

## React best practives

- Use React.memo and useMemo: React.memo can help reduce unnecessary re-renders of components, while useMemo can memoize expensive computations.

- Use the shouldComponentUpdate lifecycle method: Implementing shouldComponentUpdate can help prevent unnecessary re-renders of components.

- Use the virtual DOM: React's virtual DOM can help reduce the number of DOM manipulations needed to update the UI, improving performance.

- Use code splitting: Code splitting can help reduce the initial load time of a React app by splitting the code into smaller chunks that are loaded on demand.

- Optimize images: Compressing and resizing images can reduce their file size and improve page load times.
